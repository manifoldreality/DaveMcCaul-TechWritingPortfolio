#Homework 4: Being Independent + Teaming with Stakeholders

In this folder I've included a file in which I analyze a white paper and (1) identify potential sources of information and (2) determine which are primary or secondary. 

**Task**:

* Analyze the provided case study or document to identify which information can be independently researched and which requires consultation with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).
* Create a detailed outline categorizing these elements accordingly.
