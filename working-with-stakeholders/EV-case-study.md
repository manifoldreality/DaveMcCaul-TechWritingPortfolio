| Primary Information   | Original, firsthand data     | * Consumer preference studies<br> * Electric vehicle trip data                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Secondary Information | Interpreted or compiled data | * “Nowadays, fuel economy and pollutant emissions are keenly felt topics” <br> * “Consumers with better understanding [of EVs] are generally more willing to pay a Premium for the technology” <br> * “Batteries recycling will become economically possible” – when, how? |
| Independent Research  | Publicly accessible data     | * Trends in electric car sales (IEA data) <br> * EDF paper on impacts of IRA on EV manufacturing investments                                                                                                                                                           |
| SME Required          | Expert interpretation needed | * Which factors influence the price difference between EVs and conventional vehicles? Is this expected to change and how? <br> * What motivates consumers to switch from conventional vehicles to EVs?                                                                 |
