# Interactivity Content in Documentation

In this folder I have included a file in which I describe an [open-source project](https://github.com/BenTheChi/dance-chives) I am currently contributing to as a Junior Technical Writer. The goal of this open-source project is to create a dance competition database and website called "Dance Chives," where organizers, dancers, and fans/spectators can track competitions and upload videos and other metadata. 

As of March 2025, this Dance Chives project is just getting started. To assist the team of developers and UX designers, I created a figma diagram mapping out the workflow for users and administrators of this site.
