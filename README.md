## About Me
I am a Junior Technical Writer and Senior Systems Analyst with experience creating user manuals for software at Wildflower Health, a SaaS healthcare technology startup. I also have a decade of experience writing and designing ecommerce product pages for technical products such as SSDs, routers, DSLR cameras, and audio receivers. I enjoy acting as a communications liaison between technical and marketing teams, and creating documentation that appeals to a wide audience without sacrificing technical detail. 

I have experience with html, markdown, git, Visual Studio Code, and Figma. 

## About This Portfolio
I took a Technical Writing course at the Hugo House in Seattle from January to March 2025. This repository contains writing samples, diagrams, and documentation audits/rewrites that showcase work I completed during the course.
