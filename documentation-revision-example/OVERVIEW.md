# Revising for Clarity and Concision

In this folder I've included an excerpt of technical documentation for the SendBird AI Chatbot for Healthcare. There are BEFORE and AFTER versions, with the latter showing my ideas for improvement. 

The documentation in its original form described three distinct UI options for the Chatbot. My primary motive for rewriting was to assist the end user in selecting the best UI option upfront, and thereby bypass the instructions and code for the other options they're not interested in. I did this with a simple table at the outset of the documentation, where I imagined UI screenshots could be inserted so the user could select the best option at a glance. The user could then click through to the relevant instructions, which I made more concise.
