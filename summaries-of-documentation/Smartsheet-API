https://smartsheet.redoc.ly/


Purpose/Audience:
The document is for developers at companies who manage projects/workflow using Smartsheet and need to programmatically manage/access Smartsheet's tools and resources. 


Outline:
* How to access the API using tokens, how to format info retrieval requests, and what the different error codes mean
* How to authenticate users, and how the authentication process changes for government workers or overseas workers, which is a helpful security measure
* Formatting defaults for the software platform (fonts, colors, etc) and how to make systematic changes to formatting for all users--which allows for streamlined customization
* A list of accepted programming languages for SDKs that allow for additional Smartsheet customization
