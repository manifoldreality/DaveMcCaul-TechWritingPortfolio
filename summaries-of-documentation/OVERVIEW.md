# Identifying the Purpose and Audience

In this folder I have included two files, each of which links to a piece of technical documentation. 

In each file I try to summarize the purpose and audience of the documentation and give a high-level overview of topics covered. For technical documentation to be effective, the end user should immediately be able to recognize the purpose and audience. This can often be accomplished via a good intro section and/or a well-organized outline.
