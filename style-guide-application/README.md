# Homework 6: Study Technical Field Guides

In this folder, I have included a file in which I copied/pasted an excerpt from Vimeo's API documentation and revised it according to Microsoft's Technical Writing Style Guide.

**Objective**: Understand the importance of style guides and apply their guidelines to produce consistent and professional technical documents.

**Task**: Select a technical style guide relevant to your field or interest. *(Google’s? Microsoft’s?)*

**Requirements**:

- **Application**: Revise a doc of your choice to align with the style guide's standards that you selected. *(EX: If you selected the Google Developer Style Guide, then revise your chosen document according to THAT style guide’s standards.)*
- **Reflection**: Discuss challenges faced during the revision process and what you learned.
