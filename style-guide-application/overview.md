# Style Guide Application

In this folder, I have included a file in which I copied/pasted an excerpt from Vimeo's API documentation and revised it according to Microsoft's Technical Writing Style Guide.

## Results

Here, Microsoft's style guide made the API documentation much more concise and direct, which a busy developer might appreciate.

However, much of the personality and charm of the original language was lost, which some of Vimeo's end users might not appreciate. 

## Conclusion

Consistent application of style guides is essential. It's best to work backward from the end user and their needs when writing a style guide. In this example (and were it up to me), I think a "happy medium" approach between concision and personality might have worked best.
