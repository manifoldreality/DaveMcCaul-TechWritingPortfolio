# User Personas and Learning Paths

One way of analyzing the efficacy of technical documentation is to imagine different end users and then ask yourself whether the documentation satisfies their particular needs. Here I have included two files, each of which links to technical documentation I found online. I've invented a different **User Persona** for each piece of documentation and mapped out a **Learning Path** for each. I concluded that both pieces of documentation offered straightforward navigation for these users.
